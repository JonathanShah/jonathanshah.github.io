### How is a grayscale image represented on a computer? How about a color image?
An image is made up of pixels, in a grayscale image the image is represented by a 2D matrix of values, each value determines the intensity of the pixel, from white to black, 0 to 255. To produce colour images Red, green and blue channels are arranged in 2d arrays from 0 to 255. These three arrays combine to form a final coloured image.
