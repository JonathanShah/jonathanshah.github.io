Image of the process

What does this look like step by step,
1* convert 3000 MNIST audio files to spectograms.
2* Tensorflow's API creates a CNN with multiple 2D convolution layers.
3* The network attemps to classify the spectograms in 10 distinct classes. 
4* Final validation accuracy is about 95%.
