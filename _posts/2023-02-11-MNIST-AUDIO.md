## Hello

Image of the process

What does this look like step by step,
1* We convert 3000 MNIST audio files to spectograms.
2* We use Tensorflow's API to create a CNN with multiple 2D convolution layers.
3* The network prove excellent at classifying the spectograms in 10 distinct classes. 
4* Final validation accuracy is about 95%.
